# JS_IP_grabber
(ENG) A simple "whats my IP address" script, contained in a HTML page, where the IP of the client is sent to an email address.

This HTML page contains a script for showing your IP address. In addition to this, the IP address is sent to an email addres that you can choose by editing the script.

Thats my first JS script ever, created only for educational purposes, so if you have some tips write them in the issues, I'll appreciate it.
